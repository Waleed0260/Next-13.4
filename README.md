<b>Why we should choose Recoil as our global state management tool ?</b>


<b>Centralized State Management:</b> Recoil.js allows you to create and manage a centralized state store, known as an "atom," which can be accessed and modified by any component in your application. 
<hr/>
<b>Dependency Tracking:</b> Recoil.js automatically tracks dependencies between atoms and selectors. This means that when an atom is updated, any components that depend on that atom will be automatically re-rendered, ensuring that your UI is always in sync with the underlying state.
</hr>
<b>Asynchronous State:</b> Recoil.js supports asynchronous state management, allowing you to handle async operations such as fetching data from an API or performing side effects. 
</hr>
<b>Scalability and Performance:</b> Recoil.js is designed to be highly scalable and optimized for performance. It leverages React's efficient rendering and reconciliation mechanisms, allowing you to build large-scale applications without sacrificing performance.
